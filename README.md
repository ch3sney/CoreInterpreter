# CoreInterpreter

Hello! Running my program should be pretty simple. Simply run the following commands from the **src** folder:

```
> javac Interpreter.java
```

```
> java Interpreter ../data/test.txt ../data/testData.txt
```

You can specify the input code and data to wherever you want!

This project was created in IntelliJ IDEA, so if you want to run in an IDE, I would recommend using it.

Otherwise there are no other instructions to report. Thank you for checking out my project!
